# FIND YOUR ROOF

This project is a web application built using Next.js and React. It aims to help homeless people in Chicago find affordable rental houses or nearby shelters, search for jobs, and upload documents to our reliable database.

#Note that this is cloned from a private repository with contributions from 3 other teammates. This repository showcases the work put into the development of the web app over the course of a semester.
